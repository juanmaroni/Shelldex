# Shelldex

## Name
The name is pretty simple: mixing the "shell", Poké-"dex" and Shellder. Wooooaaaaah!

## Purpose
The Python script asks for an existing Pokémon in [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to show some data in the terminal about it. There is no Pokémon named "Missingno", so, please, DONT'T TRY IT.

## Use
You need Python 3. I started developing it with Python 3.7.

Just run:

    python shelldex.py

Or:

    python shelldex.py shellder

If a Pokémon has a composed name, it must be written separated by a hyphen (for example, "tapu-koko").

## Future
I will keep adding stuff while I have something to learn... And while I am having fun doing it.
